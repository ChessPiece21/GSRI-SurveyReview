# GSRI Survey Review
As an Instructional Design and Outreach Specialist for the UW Libraries' Office of Learning Services (OLS), I am performing data analysis and visualization of survey respondents from the [Graduate Student Research Institute](https://sites.uw.edu/libid/), or GSRI, a yearly online workshop offered by OLS to help incoming graduate students understand research.

## Purpose
GSRI is undergoing changes. For the upcoming Summer 2023 iteration, the workshop was recently transitioned from Canvas, UW's learning management system (LMS), to [UW Sites](https://sites.uw.edu/), a UW static-site generator using Wordpress's engine.
<br><br>
Ideally, with this transition, we will have new changes in the content thanks to the structure of a static site vs. an LMS. To better inform the type of content we may need, I decided to take the lead and do some data visualizations, using R, on the survey data from a few previous GSRI iterations. 
<br><br>
It is my hope that the data analysis and visualization I perform will help us identify the information needs of incoming graduate students, so that they can be more successful in their time at UW and beyond. 

## Research Questions
- Are there certain academic fields and disciplines that are over- or under-represented within GSRI? And if so, can we add more specific content to their fields?
- Is there a higher rate of satisfaction with GSRI participants in the synchronous (Zoom and Slack) or asynchronous (Slack only) session? 
- Are UW graduate students overall satisfied with GSRI? Do they believe it is a good introduction to graduate-level work?

## Limitations
This survey data is not fully representative of the GSRI participants -- in the 2022 survey alone, **only 50% of participants responded**, across two GSRI sessions. However, the samples received do encompass the diverse disciplines and academic interests of the participants.

## Findings
To be updated.

## Notes
- I'm wondering if I can get [U501](https://grad.uw.edu/for-students-and-post-docs/u501-graduate-school-orientation/) survey response data, as our office is doing competitor analysis with this program to see overlap and differences between U501 and GSRI, in a hope that it can better help us define the scope and content of our workshop.
