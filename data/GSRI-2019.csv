I was honestly blown away by how many resources are available at UW to support student research and writing. I bookmarked pages like crazy.","Queries & alerts, and the breakdown about which citation managers provide what services.",I think I was expecting this institute to talk about ethnographic/field research and how I could get started learning about those methods - so I would have at least liked to know if there's anywhere on campus that I can go to learn more about that side of humanities research.,"I was skeptical about how informative it would be, but I'm really grateful that I had the opportunity to participate. It helped allay a lot of my fears about starting grad school by giving me a sense of the landscape of resources available at UW, as well as real-world strategies for making the most of those resources. I also appreciate that it connected me to mentors and facilitators who were so kind and helpful when it came to my questions â€” I know I will be more likely to reach out to university librarians as research questions arise during my tenure at UW. I can't imagine an incoming student who wouldn't benefit from this course, though I do wish it had been stretched across a little more time (ex. 5 modules over 2 weeks) to increase participation. Thank you for all your help!"

I often feel like it's hard to know how to narrow the search terms without it feeling like an arbitrary process.,"Overall I think this was a valuable experience. I don't know that I got a lot out of the first two modules - most that content was information I already knew (different databases, searching strategies). I feel like I could be more efficient at finding research articles using databases and would like to learn how to do this faster, but I didn't really learn any new strategies in that regard. I did have a couple years of experience working in research labs/writing academic papers beforehand, so I might have felt differently if I was brand new to research. The helpfulness of having a cohort model was a little hit or miss for me - some of the comments and discussions were more valuable than others, but it was nice to have a group of people to hold you accountable for the material each day. The latter modules about UW specific resources were really useful - there are a lot of resources here that I don't think I ever would have known existed. Thanks for all your hard work to put this on!"
